## Brief

### 1 Player Game

These criteria must be met:
 - Roll the dice to begin the game.
 - The dice appears on the first roll.
 - When a dice is rolled, the score adds up.
 - Once the score passes 20, you win.
 - However, if you hit ‘1’ then you lose (if less than score of 20).
 - If the player won or lost, the player can start the game again.
 - You may want to change the score to any number other than 20

### 2 Player Game

These criteria must be met:
 - Click ‘New Game’ to begin.
 - Player 1 goes first. 
 - You can roll the dice however many times you wish.
 - In the ‘Current’ box, it gives you the current score as you roll the dice.
 - After each roll, player 1 may choose to ‘hold’ the score, which will then appear in the middle of player 1 as the total score so for
 - Player 2 begins to roll.
 - If the player hits ‘1’ without holding any score, the current score will reset, and the next player begins to roll again.
 - Once one of the players hits 20 or more score, that player wins!
